emacs-easy-ide
==============

It was called emacs-easy-ide because I want to make it as easy as an IDE to use.

## Clarity

This configuration emphasizes clarity. It's documented well and structured well.

## Configuration

Use C-f11 to cycle configuration file and configuration directory.

It is so nice to use.
