The HTML Small Element (<small>) makes the text font size one size smaller (for example, from large to medium, or from small to x-small) down to the browser's minimum font size.Â  In HTML5, this element is repurposed to represent side-comments and small print, including copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation.
