** Setup

This package uses cask as package manager, you need to install cask through
instruction [[http://cask.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide/installation.html][here]].

After setup cask, setup of this package is easy, just clone this repo and
rename it to =~/.emacs.d=, run =cask install=.

Only the first time you need to run =cask install=.

** Introduction of Usage

After installing, you can start to type.

Use =C-x C-f= to open a file, if the file is inside a project, the project is
automatically recorded. Next time you could open the project with =C-z p p=.

When editing, you could use =ESC= to toggle editing mode between *emacs* and
*vim*, in either mode, *Sublime Text* and *TextMate* style key bindings work
fine.

When you don't know a keybinding, you could use =C-z c k= to view and edit key
binding definition table.

You can save your file in several ways: =C-x C-s= is emacs way, =:w= is vim
way, and also =s-s= the Sublime Text way.

When you are working with git, for example, you want to push your local commit,
=C-z g g= to open *magit* status panel, and do the staging, commiting, merging,
rebasing, pushing and pulling there.
